# DOM Art

This is an experimental project for getting familiar with image processing in JS. Works on mobile devices too. 

## Features

- Input type => Can be either `checkbox` or `radio`.
- Threshold => Can be used in order to adjust threshold value which indicates `falsy` or `truthy` state of the input. 
- Scale => Indicates how many inputs should be used to render the image. Higher value produces better quality image. 

This project uses [Media Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) to capture video from the camera and processes it to produce DOM version of the video.
