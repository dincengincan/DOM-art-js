# DOM Art

This is an experimental project for getting familiar with image processing in JS.

This project uses [Media Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) to capture video from the camera and processes it to produce DOM version of the video. For now, DOM element options are limited to checkbox and radio.

## Demo
